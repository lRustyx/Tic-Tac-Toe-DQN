# Tic-Tac-Toe-DQN

A Tic Tac Toe agent is trained using deep Q network against an agent which uses mini-max policy.



While the code is functional, the project is currently put on hold as my travel laptop does not possess the processing power to train the model.
DQN requires large batchsizes and requires much more episodes than regular Q learning. This results in long training times and thus slow iteration of code and fine tuning of hyperparameters.
